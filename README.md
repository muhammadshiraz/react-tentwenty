## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a minimal configuration to start building a React application without using any boilerplate or create-react-app.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/muhammadshiraz/react-tentwenty.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start Development Server:** Start the webpack development server to run the application locally:

```sh

```
This will launch the development server, and you can access the application at http://localhost:9000.

4. **Build the Application:** To build the production-ready application, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

The built files will be located in the dist directory.
